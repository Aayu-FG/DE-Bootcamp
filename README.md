## Data Engineering Roadmap. 
### Python fundamentals
-	Array/Lists: (slicing, sorting, array manipulation, multi dim. array)
-	Dictionary 
-	Functions/ Lambda functions
-	List Comprehension / Dictionary Comprehension
-	Zip, unpacking 
-	OOP Concepts
### File handling:
-	Work with csv, Json, parquet files
-	Csv parsing, Deal with exceptions
### Database connection and Query management:
-	Establish connection with database (postgres, SQLite)
-	Create tables and Perform DML operations
### Data transformation / Data Manipulation:
-	Introduction to pandas
-	Load data in dataframe and perform transformation
-	Explode/ Flatten JSON
-	Aggregate functions
-	Build Unit tests for data validations. Business rules.
-	Error handling **
-	Performance tuning/ optimization  **
### Cloud Fundamentals/ Cloud-Based data platform:
-	Snowflake. Create account. 
-	Azure Fundamentals. / GCP fundamentals.
### Case study:
#### Provide relevant case study after every module covered.
-	File based handling and performed full load, incremental load and transformations
-	Database full load, incremental load and transformations
-	Basic data pipeline. And Scheduling. 
-	Data Engineering best practices
#### Prerequisites and Evaluation:
-	All hands on will be done on Git repository. Set up github account and Local git. 
-	Maintain documentation for all work done. Even for setups.
-	After every module conduct a written test covering concepts in the module.  
-	Plan is to include a code walk through session.
