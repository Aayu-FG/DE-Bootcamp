# Final Capstone 2: Database-Driven Analytics Platform

## Project Overview
Build a comprehensive database-driven analytics platform that demonstrates mastery of database operations, data modeling, ETL processes, and business intelligence. This capstone integrates database design, advanced SQL operations, data warehousing concepts, and analytical reporting.

## Business Scenario
You work for a financial services company that needs a robust analytics platform to support regulatory reporting, risk analysis, and business intelligence. The platform must handle transactional data, customer information, financial products, and market data while maintaining strict data integrity and providing fast analytical queries.

The system needs to support:
- **Regulatory Reporting**: Compliance with financial regulations
- **Risk Analytics**: Credit risk, market risk, and operational risk analysis
- **Customer Analytics**: Customer segmentation and lifetime value analysis
- **Product Performance**: Financial product profitability and performance metrics
- **Market Analysis**: Market trends and competitive analysis
